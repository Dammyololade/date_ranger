## Features
* Layout-agnostic: Conforms to any width by calculating its height internally
* Simple architecture: Built with default flutter architecture without depending on other state management packages
* Highly customisable:  Almost every thing can be changed including dimensions since dimensions are adjusted internally
* Picker types:  You can swap between a regular date picker and a date range picker easily. 

This project is a starting point for a Dart

a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.
